# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Overview

This project is developed in C++ and includes several laboratory works and a course project, focusing on fundamental data structures and algorithms.

### Labs

1. **Lab 1: Doubly Linked List**
   - Implementation of a doubly linked list with basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

2. **Lab 2: Divide and Conquer**
   - Implementation of divide and conquer algorithms, demonstrating the principle of breaking down a problem into smaller sub-problems.

3. **Lab 3: Sorting Algorithms**
   - Implementation of various sorting algorithms:
     1. **Insertion Sort**
     2. **Selection Sort**
     3. **Bubble Sort**
     4. **Merge Sort**
     5. **Shell Sort**
     6. **Quick Sort**

4. **Lab 4: Binary Tree**
   - Implementation of a binary tree with fundamental operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

5. **Course Project: Huffman Coding Algorithm**
   - Implementation of the Huffman coding algorithm for data compression.

## Requirements

- C++17 or higher
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
