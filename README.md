# Basic Data Structures

## Overview

This project, developed in C++, is a collection of laboratory works focused on implementing fundamental data structures and sorting algorithms.

### Trees

The following types of trees are implemented:
- Tree
- Binary Tree
- Red-Black Tree

### Sorts

In the third lab work, a set of sorting algorithms is presented:
1. **Insertion Sort**
2. **Selection Sort**
3. **Bubble Sort**
4. **Merge Sort**
5. **Shell Sort**
6. **Quick Sort**

## Requirements

- C++17 or higher
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
